    Purpose and Background 
           The purpose of this projecy is to analyze stock market. The background of this project is that Steve wants to expand the entire dataset to include the stock market and do more research for his parents. So I need to refactor the code in order to generate the information he wants.

        AY Ticker has the least data in daily volume, and RUN Ticker has the biggest positive change, which is 84.0%. ENPH has the second largest positive change, which is 81.9%.
        Also, the screenshots and code well described the results. 
Summary 
     The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general 
     Pros: My code is better organized, and has good test coverage so changes can be made confidence and has a high degree of automation so more tests can be run quicker. 
     Cons: I can potentially introduce bugs that my tests won't catch. 

     The advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script 
     Pros: it performs the analysis at a much faster rate. 
     Cons: I must introduce the data in the exact same format for the code to be successful.
